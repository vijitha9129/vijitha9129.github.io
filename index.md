### ML Projects

[Generating Synthetic Images using GAN Architecture](/sample_page)
<p> Designed and implemented a GAN architecture that can generate synthetic images of human faces
**Algorthims used**:  
        BasicGAN architecture that ran for 300 epochs with the training size of 4125 images. 
        <img src="images/BasicGAN.png?raw=true"/>
        StleGAN Atchitecture that ran for 3000 epochs with training size of just 12 imges.
        <img src="images/styleGAN.png?raw=true"/>
**Tech Stack**: TensorFLow, Keras, Python, Google Colab (GPU and TPU for processing)
<p/>


[Last Mile Delivery](/sample_page)
<p> Analysis for a postal company which delivers its packages everyday. There are certain vehicle sizes assigned to each of its routes and the end goal is to optimize the vehicle utilization and eventually reduce the carbon foorprint of the delivery service. So we had to determine the vehicles that are over utilized or underutilized and re-assign the routes for optimal usage. For example, if the cubic volume of the package size is 100 cubic feet then a vehicle which is close to this capacity has to be chosen and a bigger vehicle might be a wrong choice as it will be over utilized. Bigger vehicle means extra usage of fuel and hence carbon foot print is increased.  
**Algorthims used**:  
        Supervised Learning to predict optimal vehicle based on history parcel capacity: Decision tree and Random forest 
        Time series to forecast the parcel capacity for next 10 days and then assign the optimal available vehicle at the depot
**Tech Stack**: Python – Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, AWS Sagemaker, EC2

[Customer segmentation for E-commerce company](/pdf/sample_presentation.pdf)
<p> Segment the Customers based on Recency, Frequency, and Monetary parameters so that the company can target its customers efficiently. Analyzed the Customers based on 3 factors: Recency, Monetary and Frequency. 
**Algortihms used**: K-Means Clustering and Hierarchical Clustering  with 3 Cluster Ids
Customers with Cluster Id 1 are the customers with a high amount of transactions as compared to other customers.
Customers with Cluster Id 1 are frequent buyers.
Customers with Cluster Id 2 are not recent buyers and hence the least of importance from the business point of view.
**Tech Stack**: Python – Pandas, Numpy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
